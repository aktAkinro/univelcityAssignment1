# # loop means to go over something. it is a way of going over a block of code.
# # we have two types.
# # for loop - do something for a time frame or for a specified number.

# # for i in range(5);
# # print(i + 1)

# #list comprehension

# a =[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]
# b =[]

# for i in a:
#     if i%2 == 0: b.append(i)
    
# print(b)


# a1 =[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,2,3,4]
# b2 =[i for i in a if i%2 == 0]
# print(b)

# a = [(0,"sheldon"),(1,"penny")]
# for e in a:
#     print(e)
#     print(e[1])




# a2 = [0,1,2]
# b2 = [2,4,6]
# c2 = []
# for i in a2:
#     for x in b2:
#      c2.append(i + x)
# print(c2)




# Given a two python list. iterate both lists simultaneously
#  such that list1 should display item in original order and list2 in reverse order

# list1 = ["10","20","30","40"]
# list2 = ["100","200","300","400"]
# list2.reverse()
# for x,y in zip(list1,list2):
#     print(x,y)






# while loop is affection by condition
# x = 1
# while x < 4
# print(2)

# write a code that countsdown from 10 - 0
# x = 10
# while x > 0:
#     print(x)
#     x-=1

# while True:
    # print('I am a boy') inffinite loop
