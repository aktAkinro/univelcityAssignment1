# 0 is the first value, -1 represents the last value. negative is starting from behind





# len is a built in function used to check the length of your value

# course = "python for you"
# print(len(course))


# methods - functions specific to string. access them using "."

# course.upper() to covert all to upper

# course = "hello peopple"
# print(course.upper())
# print(course.lower())



# find method

# course = "hello peopple"
# print(course.find('o'))

# to replace. you can also use it for letters but it is case sensitive
# course = "hello peopple"
# print(course.replace('hello', 'yhelo'))

# # in is used here for boolean to knw if a word is present
# print('peopple' in course)
 

#  in arithmetic operators, the exponentiation i fist then mult or divi then add or subtr but once you add parenthesis then that comes first even if it has add or sub

# math functions
# to round up a figure use round built in funct
# x = 2.9
# print(round(x))

# absolute function abs to return a positive number
# x = 2.9
# print(abs(-2.9))


# to import math module so you have access to mathematical functions simply type import_math then put math.
# import math


# ceil function would round up and floor would remove decimal
# import_math

# math.ceil
# math.floor
