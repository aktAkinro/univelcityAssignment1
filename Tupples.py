# They are ordered so they can be gotten by indexing or slicing Just like lists but they are unchangeable 
# so they maintain position all through

# T1 = (False, "True" , 100)
# T2 = (1,4,9)
# T3 = T1 + T2
# print(T3)

# note that T3 is a new tuple and remains unchangeable

# two methods of a tupple
#  1. index and 2. count(how many times an element appears)


atuple = (1,2,3)
del atuple
# print(atuple)
# a tuple can be deleted

# a tuple can be created without ()
mytupple = "This", "is", "are"
# print(type(mytupple))

# unpacking in general programming
first,second,third = "This", "is", "are"
# print(first)


atuple = ('Orange')
# tupples must always have a comma at the end of the value even if it is just one value. so the above is a string
